# 👋 Hello, I'm Hashir Bawany!

[cite_start]I am a **Master of Public Policy** candidate [cite: 6] [cite_start]specializing in **Data Analytics** [cite: 6] [cite_start]at the University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy [cite: 4][cite_start], expected to graduate in June 2026[cite: 7].

My work focuses on leveraging **data science, econometrics, and policy analysis** to drive impactful decisions in development, finance, and public service.

### 🛠️ Core Skills & Expertise

I specialize in the full data lifecycle—from ingestion and cleaning to advanced modeling and visualization.

* [cite_start]**Programming & Databases:** **Python** [cite: 52] [cite_start](Pandas [cite: 30][cite_start], Scikit-learn [cite: 30][cite_start], NumPy [cite: 30][cite_start], Streamlit [cite: 30][cite_start]), **R** [cite: 52][cite_start], **SQL** [cite: 52][cite_start], **VBA** [cite: 52][cite_start], **Stata** [cite: 52][cite_start], and **Excel**[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**Data Modeling & Analysis:** Machine Learning [cite: 8] [cite_start](LASSO/Elastic Net [cite: 29][cite_start], Clustering [cite: 29][cite_start]), Econometrics (Logit Regression [cite: 50][cite_start]), Program Evaluation [cite: 8][cite_start], and Sensitivity Analysis[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization & BI:** Developing interactive dashboards using **Power BI** [cite: 52][cite_start], **Streamlit** [cite: 30][cite_start], **Matplotlib** [cite: 30][cite_start], and **Tableau**[cite: 52].
* [cite_start]**Geospatial Analysis:** Merging governmental and field data, and applying K-means clustering to identify communities with high mortgage-default vulnerability[cite: 43].

### 💡 Highlighted Projects & Experience

[cite_start]My professional experience includes roles at the **World Bank** [cite: 24][cite_start], **Development Innovation Lab** [cite: 16][cite_start], and **London School of Economics**[cite: 31], where I applied data science to solve real-world problems.

| Project/Role | Focus | Key Achievement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]**World Bank** (Summer Intern) [cite: 25] | Development Impact Evaluation | [cite_start]Built an **interactive geospatial dashboard using Python/Streamlit** [cite: 28] [cite_start]to visualize eligible Sahel countries, reducing review time by $\sim 75$ hours[cite: 28]. |
| [cite_start]**Development Innovation Lab** (Research Assistant) [cite: 19] | ETL & Automation | [cite_start]Built an **ETL pipeline** using vendor APIs [cite: 22] [cite_start]and **generalized R code for sensitivity analysis** [cite: 23][cite_start], automating updates across $150+$ tables [cite: 23] [cite_start]and saving $40$ hours/month[cite: 23]. |
| [cite_start]**LSE** (Research Associate) [cite: 32] | Financial Data Analysis | [cite_start]Created a novel dataset with $180+$ variables by **scraping and cleaning unstructured data** from $3,000+$ energy contracts in Stata[cite: 35]. |
| [cite_start]**Healthcare Fraud Detection** [cite: 44] | Data & Programming in Python | [cite_start]Applied case-mix normalization to administrative claims data, uncovering $\sim \$1.5$M in potential fraud from overcharging[cite: 45]. |
