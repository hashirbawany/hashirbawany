# 👋 Hello, I'm Hashir Bawany!

I am a **Master’s candidate in Economics and Data Science** at the University of Chicago, with experience in **finance, research, and applied data analytics**.  
My background in economics gives me a strong foundation in **causal thinking** – I can look at a problem, understand what drives it, and use data to quantify those drivers.

I work across the full analytics pipeline, including **data extraction, cleaning, modeling, visualization, and communication**, and I enjoy solving real business and operational problems using structured analysis.
