# 👋 Hello, I'm Hashir Bawany!

I am a **Master of Public Policy** candidate specializing in **Data Analytics** at the University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy, expected to graduate in June 2026.

My work focuses on leveraging **data science, econometrics, and policy analysis** to drive impactful decisions in development, finance, and public service.

### 🛠️ Core Skills & Expertise

I specialize in the full data lifecycle—from ingestion and cleaning to advanced modeling and visualization.

* **Programming & Databases:** **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Streamlit), **R**, **SQL**, **VBA**, **Stata**, and **Excel**.
* **Data Modeling & Analysis:** Machine Learning (LASSO/Elastic Net, Clustering), Econometrics (Logit Regression), Program Evaluation, and Sensitivity Analysis.
* **Data Visualization & BI:** Developing interactive dashboards using **Power BI**, **Streamlit**, **Matplotlib**, and **Tableau**.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Merging governmental and field data, and applying K-means clustering to identify communities with high mortgage-default vulnerability.

### 💡 Highlighted Projects & Experience

My professional experience includes roles at the **World Bank**, **Development Innovation Lab**, and **London School of Economics**, where I applied data science to solve real-world problems.

| Project/Role | Focus | Key Achievement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **World Bank** (Summer Intern) | Development Impact Evaluation | Built an **interactive geospatial dashboard using Python/Streamlit** to visualize eligible Sahel countries, reducing review time by $\sim 75$ hours. |
| **Development Innovation Lab** (Research Assistant) | ETL & Automation | Built an **ETL pipeline** using vendor APIs and **generalized R code for sensitivity analysis**, automating updates across $150+$ tables and saving $40$ hours/month. |
| **LSE** (Research Associate) | Financial Data Analysis | Created a novel dataset with $180+$ variables by **scraping and cleaning unstructured data** from $3,000+$ energy contracts in Stata. |
| **Healthcare Fraud Detection** | Data & Programming in Python | Applied case-mix normalization to administrative claims data, uncovering $\sim \$1.5$M in potential fraud from overcharging. |
